#A string is a data structure that has indexable data within it
#meaning it is basically a LIST data structure with letters as list members

#lets define a string variable
fruit = "banana"
letter = fruit[0]
print(letter)

#The above code will print "b" which is the first letter in banana
#so by using the double brackets [], we could access the individual letters
#of the list

x = 3
w = fruit[x-1]
print(w)
